1) Story about the friend from the 90s who wants to get his guestbook running.
2) In order to do this, we need to persist it somewhere - the database.
3) We're going to use SQLAlchemy.
  - it's an ORM. It maps the database schema in the language that we know and use (python)
  - has a declarative syntax (entites are defined as classes)
  - use any relational database you want. and switch anytime.
4) Show SQLAlchemy documentation (learn how it can be installed and so on..)
5) Now, show the website. We're not going to improve the face but focus on
  making the functionality work.
6) We'll use the flask extension since we're using flask (flask has extensions too).

And for the actual coding goodies...
7) Show the initial configuration (engine configuration) and the integration with Flask
8) Declare the table (class Entry: name, email, content), then build the database.
9) Now, demonstrate how stuff can be saved. (db.session.add; db.session.commit)

10) It doesn't show the guestlogs yet. We need to query the guestbook items.
  - show how to query the guestlogs.
  - print content first.

11) Now, how do we show them inside the webpage?
  - we pass the context via render_template

12) Now that it's inside the webpage. printing them normally doesn't show the contents.
